Insert gif's into any conversation easily and effortlessly

For now just building a list of gif's with the format of web address followed by a name spaced short description:

http://addressofthegif.com short_description

Spending no more than 30 mins a day on this.

In order to use:
- need some front end to show the gifs. I used javscript to show the results.
- need to grab the input by getting $q
